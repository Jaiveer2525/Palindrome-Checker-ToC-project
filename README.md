# Palindrome checker using Turing Machine

This repository was created as the Project submittion for my Project for Theory of Computation.

As per the Title suggests, the system mimics a Turing Machine in C++ and uses said Turing Machine to check whether or not a user inputed string is a palindrome or not.

**The program only uses the charachters 'a' and 'b'.**

All whitespaces are disregarded. any other charachter is treated as an exception and unsupported.

- Programming Language used : C++
- Other Technology used : Qt6 through the use of Qt Creator.
